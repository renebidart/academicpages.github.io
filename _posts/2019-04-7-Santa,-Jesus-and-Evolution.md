## The end of Jesus
When I was 10 years old, the thought of believing in Santa was a ridiculous fiction for naive children. Two years earlier that was me. The thought of a flying fat man made me feel uneasy, because it was logically inconsistent with everything the world had taught me previously. But at the same time I didn't fully question it.

A few years later I felt similarly uneasy when hearing about Jesus rising from the dead in a church related event. It couldn’t be true, but it felt wrong to deny it. Similarly to Santa, it wasn't immediately abandoned, clear mo where I decided the Bible was a work of fiction, it just slowly became less less literally true to me until I abandoned it entirely, just as I had done with every other deity that had ever existed.


But I always wondered what I was missing. All these people are Christians, they can’t just be delusional, right? I assumed that some day I would understand their point of view, or even start to see the validity of it. Maybe this was just like some of the other things I hadn’t understood as a child, like why a house with waterfront view could possibly matter, if you don’t have a beach for swimming. Or why architecture matters or why I should place some importance on the views of older people. But for years I never understood. I would accept the bible must be a good book, but I couldn’t place it on a higher ranking than a book like the origin of species or sapiens.

<br>

This year I finally understood. The bible is fundamentally more than just good book.

<br>

People came to dominate the world not only through physical strength or intelligence, but from our society, culture, and the ability to organize large groups to achieve some huge undertaking like the pyramids or the international space station. Just as natural selection determines which individual’s DNA gets passes on, encoding our physical design, there is group level natural selection happening, with culture getting passed on. Our culture is in a large part encoded by the bible and religion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"></span>

<br>

And this isn’t just some random culture, this is one of the few that survived thousands of years and came to dominate out planet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"></span>

<br>

Whether we like it or not, and whether or not it has much factual truth, the bible has encoded the culture that survived. There are truths about ourself in the bible, owing to the fact that out society is based off of it, in the same way out DNA holds truths about ourselves. This is totally different than some other good book like the origin of species. Its power is directly from its longevity and influence, and this has more influence over our culture than any other.
