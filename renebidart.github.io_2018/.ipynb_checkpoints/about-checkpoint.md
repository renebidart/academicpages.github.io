I am a PhD student at the University of Waterloo focusing on machine learning and medical imaging. I'm working on automated diagnosis for pathology, as well as neural network optimization. If you're interested in these problems get in touch!

Previously I finished a Master's in statistics at Waterloo, and before this I did my undergrad in Math and Economics at Carleton University.

This was made with a theme designed by [Ben Centra](http://bencentra.com) using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)



<!-- * Carleton B.Math graduate in Math/Economics, where focused on economics initially, but in my final year my interest changed to statistics and machine learning. 
 
* In the co-op program at Carleton. (Work experience is on my [linkedin](https://ca.linkedin.com/pub/rene-bidart/62/281/a2a) ) 

* Currently defending financial stability and taking in all the knowledge I can at the Bank of Canada.

* Working on some random projects including MMA fight prediction ([github](https://github.com/renebidart) ), and slowly introducing some rigor to my life by making my way through Bishop's classic text [Pattern Recgonition and Machine Learning](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/PRML/) -->
